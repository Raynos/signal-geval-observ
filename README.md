# Signal library

Demonstrations of how to break a Signal into to Events and Behaviours.

## Motivation

An Event is a sequence of discrete values. In this particular case
    we shall refere to an event as a `geval` instance.

A Behaviour is a value that changes over time. In this particular
    case we shall refer to a behaviour as an `observ` instance.

In some libraries, like Elm and RX.js these two different concepts
    and data structures are put together into a single interface
    to keep things uniform. In Elm it's called a `Signal`, and
    in RX.js it's called an `Observable`.
